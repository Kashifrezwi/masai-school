        <h1> &#60;b&#62; &#160;tag :</h1>
        <p>The &#160;<b>&#60;b&#62;</b>&#160; HTML element is used to draw the reader's attention to the element's contents, which are not otherwise granted special importance. This was formerly known as the Boldface element, and most browsers still draw the text in boldface. However, you should not use &#160;<b>&#60;b&#62;</b>&#160; for styling text; instead, you should use the CSS font-weight property to create boldface text, or the &#160;<b>&#60;strong&#62;</b>&#160; element to indicate that text is of special importance.</p>

        <h1> &#60;i&#62; &#160;tag :</h1>
        <p>The &#160;<b>&#60;i&#62;</b>&#160; HTML element represents a range of text that is set off from the normal text for some reason, such as idiomatic text, technical terms, taxonomical designations, among others. Historically, these have been presented using <b><i>italicized</i></b> type, which is the original source of the &#160;<b>&#60;i&#62;</b>&#160; naming of this element.</p>

        <h1> &#60;u&#62; &#160;tag :</h1>
        <p>The &#160;<b>&#60;u&#62;</b>&#160; HTML element represents a span of inline text which should be rendered in a way that indicates that it has a non-textual annotation. This is rendered by default as a simple solid <b><u>underline,</u></b> but may be altered using CSS.</p>

        <h1> &#60;select&#62; &#160;tag :</h1>
        <p>The &#160;<b>&#60;select&#62;</b>&#160; HTML element represents a control that provides a menu of options. Each menu option is defined by an &#160;<b>&#60;option&#62;</b>&#160; element nested inside the

        <h1> &#60;button&#62; &#160;tag :</h1>
        <p>The &#160;<b>&#60;button&#62;</b>&#160; HTML element is an interactive element activated by a user with a mouse, keyboard, finger, voice command, or other assistive technology. Once activated, it then performs a programmable action, such as <button type="button"><b>submit</b></button> a form or open a dialog.</p>
